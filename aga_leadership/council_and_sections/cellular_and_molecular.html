<h3>Mission Statement and Foci</h3>

<p>
    <big>The CMG section occupies a unique niche within AGA since membership is not disease-based but focuses sharply on issues
        and themes related to the basic science underlying digestive diseases and gastrointestinal cell biology, with particular
        emphasis on technological and thematic innovations in the field.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>The section leaders continue to utilize the expertise and strengths of their nominating and steering committee members
        in selecting &nbsp;scientific sessions and descriptors. CMG strives to invite outside speakers who are leading scientists
        in their fields to present forward-looking scientific programming at
        <a href="http://ddw.org/home" target="_top">Digestive Disease Week&reg; (DDW).</a>
    </big>
</p>

<p>The CMG section partners with other sections to sponsor key AGA sessions emphasizing basic science, including the Funderburg
    Symposium, Grossman lecture and James W. Freston Conferences, such as the upcoming conference on exosome biology, which
    will take place in St. Paul, MN, in August 2017.</p>

<p>
    <span style="font-size: 16px;">CMG will reach out to expand the participation of non-clinician scientists in GI-related research through the development
        of programs that promote the inclusion of research scientists at DDW, with particular focus on young and upcoming
        investigators at the post-doctoral and junior faculty levels.</span>
