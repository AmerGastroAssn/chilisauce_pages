<p>The AGA Clinical Observation and Research Education (CORE) Program has been developed as a response to our
    international gastroenterology and hepatology colleagues who have expressed interest in participating in clinical
    and research opportunities in the U.S.<br/>
    <br/>
    The <a href="http://www.gastro.org/about/people/committees/international-committee" target="_top">AGA International
        Committee</a> has taken a leadership role in this matching process and will make available the necessary
    information so that interested members can be paired with mentors and institutions who can provide the desired
    experience. The purpose of this program is to attract early-career international doctors/trainees into the U.S. by
    providing basic research opportunities (one or two years) and clinical observerships (one to three months).<br/>
    &nbsp;<br/>
    The program does not provide funding, but serves as a channel to facilitate connections between interested members
    and institutions. Applicants and/or institutions are required to have adequate funding to cover their expenses.
    Arrangements including logistics and specific requirements might change from place to place.<br/>
    &nbsp;<br/>
    <strong>General Program Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>All applicants must be proficient in English.</li>
    <li>At the time of participation, they must be in the last year of their GI fellowship or within five years of
        graduating from their fellowship training program.
    </li>
    <li>The applicant must be an AGA Member (international).</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply, please reach out to the appropriate contact person, listed below. Be sure to mention the <strong>&quot;AGA
    International CORE Program&quot;.</strong>

                    the top
                    50 hospitals in the country. Baylor Dallas offers four distinctive opportunities for
                    gastrointestinal
                    clinical observerships and research opportunities: At the Baylor IBD Center, clinical trainees gain
                    confidence in managing IBD and have the opportunity to co-author an original paper while shadowing
                    Dr.

                    Center for Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Cancer Genomics will be mentored by Ajay Goel, Ph.D.,
                    while
                    working on various basic and translational aspects of gastrointestinal cancers. In the Mucosal
                    Pathobiology
                    Lab, research trainees will work with Arianne Theiss, Ph.D., performing basic science/translational
                    research
                    experiments utilizing human intestinal mucosal biopsies, novel mouse models of spontaneous ileitis,
                    intestinal organoids, and cultured epithelial cells. Research trainees at Baylor Institute for
                    Immunology
                    Research will work under Venuprasad K. Poojary, Ph.D., on highly sophisticated cell, molecular

                    1920,
                    Virginia Mason began as an 80-bed hospital with six physician offices. Today, Virginia Mason Medical
                    Center
                    is recognized as one of the nation&#39;s best health care facilities encompassing 7 centers of
                    excellence
                    including IBD, hepatology, nutrition, bariatric treatment, endoscopy, pancreas and biliary disease
                    and
                    esophagus. Virginia Mason has strong ties with its affiliated Benaroya Research Institute, a leading
                    center
                    in immunology research and the current seat for the Immune Tolerance Network program. The Virginia
                    Mason
                    Medical Center offers both clinical observerships and research opportunities to potential trainees.
                    Clinical
                    observerships include shadowing all three members of the IBD group as they provide clinical services
                    and
                    perform procedures. The estimated length of the observership is five days per week for two months.
                    Research
                    opportunities include working with two clinical investigators with experience in clinical outcomes
                    research
                    and clinical trials, and/or one translational T-cell immunologist who is involved in basic science,
                    translational work, and clinical trials. The estimated length of the research opportunity is nine
                    months.

                    strength in
                    the basic sciences with Carilion Clinic highly experienced medical staff and rich history in medical
                    education. The multidisciplinary IBD Center at Carilion Clinic, directed by Dr. Dario Sorrentino, is
                    committed to conducting groundbreaking research in IBD while offering the highest standard of care.
                    Opportunities for international visitors include several clinical IBD focused research projects (1
                    year) as
                    well as clinical observerships (1 to 3 months) of tertiary level IBD clinic and IBD endoscopy. IBD
                    surgery,
                    led by Dr. Sandy Fogel, is a busy service with up to 50-80 procedures performed each year making the
                    Center
                    one of the leaders in the U.S. Procedures performed include: resections, stricturoplasties,
                    diversions,
                    colostomies, Ileostomies, pouch procedures (including J pouch), restorative procto-colectomies,
                    revision/repair of continent ileostomies, fistula resections, open drainage of abscesses. One to
                    three
                    months observerships in IBD surgery are available to international visitors. The Advanced Endoscopy
                    Center,
                    directed by Dr. Paul Yeaton, specializes in pancreatobiliary endoscopy focusing on complex
                    diagnostic and
                    therapeutic procedures including EUS, EMR, ERCP, and many others. One to three months observerships
                    in
                    pancreatobiliary endoscopy are available to international visitors. Basic research projects are
                    tutored by
                    Dr Irving C. Allen at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg and include evaluating novel
                    infammatory
                    signaling in IBD; developing human intestinal organoids to evaluate host-microbiome interactions and
                    utilizing genetically engineered pigs to model NLR infammasome function in IBD.</p>

                    the Yale
                    University School of Medicine is a world-renowned center for biomedical research, education and
                    advanced
                    health care. Potential trainees may participate in clinical observerships or research opportunities.
                    Clinical observerships include shadowing Dr. Deborah Proctor in mostly IBD outpatient clinics;
                    however, some
                    inpatient hospital experience is also available. The length of the clinical observership would be
                    four to
                    eight weeks. Research opportunities include research experience with Dr. Fred Gorelick whose
                    laboratory
                    focuses on basic science research on the pancreas and enzyme activation. Trainees would learn about
                    the
                    basic techniques that are used in Dr. Gorelick&rsquo;s lab. The length of time would preferably be
                    6-12
                    months, but trainees could participate for a minimum of 3 months.</p>
