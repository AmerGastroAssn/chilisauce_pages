<h3 class="bar">MISSION STATEMENT AND FOCI</h3>

<p>
    <big>The NGM section of the AGA Council is dedicated to serving the field of neurogastroenterology and gastrointestinal motility
        by promoting excellence in research, innovation, education and training</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>Some of the sections main goals are:</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>1. To attract the best science and cutting-edge research in neurogastroenterology and GI motility for presentation at
        <a href="http://ddw.org/home" target="_top">Digestive Disease Week&reg; (DDW).</a>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>2. To educate and train gastroenterologists, research scientists, surgeons, physiologists, trainees, nurses and technicians
        on the latest developments in the field.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>3. To foster interdisciplinary basic science, translational and clinical research.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>4. To lead and critically examine the development of novel tools for studying neurogastroenterology and motility disorders,
        and gut and brain interactions, both at the bench side and for patient care.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>Areas of Focus:</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>1. Neurogastroenterology and GI Motility encompasses the study of the gut nerve and muscle physiology and morphology,
        and its interactions with the enteric nervous system, the brain, hormones, neurotransmitters, secretions, pharmacology
        and intestinal microbiota.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>2.This is accomplished through multiple subdisciplines that focus on the sensory neurobiology, motor function, motility
        testing, gut and brain interactions as well as the understanding and management of GI motility and functional GI
        disorders.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>3. Specifically, the main areas of focus include oropharyngeal dysphagia, achalasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
        gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain, gas and bloating, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,
        carbohydrate and other food intolerances, pseudo obstruction syndromes, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, fecal
        incontinence and pelvic floor disorders.</big>
</p>
