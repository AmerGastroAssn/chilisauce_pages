<h3 class="bar">MISSION STATEMENT AND FOCI</h3>

<p>
    <big>The EGD section continues to heavily contribute to the educational and research mission of the AGA Institute and remains
        a highly visible section at DDW&reg;.&nbsp; It is &nbsp;the second largest section in the AGA Council. The attendance
        at Digestive Disease Week&reg; (DDW) continues to be robust, with nearly all of the EGD section&rsquo;s clinical
        sessions exceeding expected capacity. The section is diverse in regards to representation of multiple upper GI diseases
        including esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.&nbsp; Advances continue to develop in the area of esophageal reflux and
        motility testing (e.g., high resolution manometry and mucosal impedance measurements), endoscopic reflux therapies
        as well as continued strong interest in both clinical and basic research in Eosinophilic esophagitis and Barrett&#39;s
        esophagus. Dominant areas of investigation in this section include esophageal physiologic testing, eosinophilic esophagitis,
        H. pylori infection and its chronic implications, GERD and extraesophageal GERD, Barrett&#39;s esophagus, esophageal
        and gastric dysmotility, and GI bleeding.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>Over the last few years, the EGD section intensified their efforts at reducing overlap by consolidating some of &nbsp;descriptors
        and proactively ensuring reduced programming redundancies.&nbsp; The section continues to work with other council
        sections in cross-sectional opportunities. Section leaders believe the EGD section will continue to play a pivotal
        role in providing excellence in research and education, and strive to meet these goals by thoughtful programming
        of clinical and research fora in line with the demand of section members.</big>
