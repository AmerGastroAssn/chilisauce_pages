        PCN, IPMN and neuroendocrine tumors.</p>

    <h5>Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms, IPMN and Neuroendocrine Tumors</h5>

    <p>This section is completely clinical for these 3 areas and any basic science work should be submitted to one of the 5
        basic science descriptors. However, the imaging and endoscopy abstracts of these 3 diseases are encouraged to be
        submitted to the endoscopy and imaging descriptor.</p>

    <h5>Pancreatic Disorders: Endoscopy and Imaging</h5>

    <p>Endoscopic and radiological imaging abstracts on all clinical pancreatic diseases are best submitted here as this section
        is specially created to accommodate this kind of work. This being a recently introduced descriptor, the work has
        better chances of getting accepted in this descriptor location.</p>

    <h5>Pancreatic Genetics, Epigenetics, Physiology, Cell Biology and Pathobiology</h5>

    <p>Considers research in mechanisms of disease initiation and promotion.</p>

            The council is divided into 13 sections that represent special interest groups among AGA members. AGA invites all members
            to join up to six sections. By joining a section, AGA members will benefit from networking opportunities, professional
            recognition and growth, and involvement in the council&rsquo;s educational programming at DDW and throughout
            the year. To join or manage your section affiliations, email
