<h3 class="bar">MISSION STATEMENT AND FOCI</h3>

<p>The mission of the AGA Council Section on Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition (OMN) is to represent and support AGA members
    who have an interest in nutritional and metabolic disorders with programming that includes topics spanning the life cycle
    from pediatrics to adulthood to geriatrics. This programming includes both OMN-specific and cross-sectional invited speaker
    sessions, as well as abstract-based platform and poster research fora. The section continues to expand its cross-sectional
    programming in order to have broader impact and appeal. The section is also pursuing a more challenging goal to draw
    attendees to
    <a href="http://www.ddw.org" target="_top">Digestive Disease Week&reg; (DDW)</a> from other societies and organizations that could benefit from and contribute to
    its programming. The OMN section also endeavors to strike a balance between basic research, including pre-clinical studies
    to develop new therapies, to shed light on disease mechanisms, and clinical and translational research, to better describe
    disease phenotypes and test new therapeutic approaches.&nbsp; Finally, the OMN section continues to focus on engaging
    trainees and junior members in all meeting activities as a worthwhile investment in the future.</p>
