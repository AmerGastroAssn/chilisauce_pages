<h3 class="bar">MISSION STATEMENT AND FOCI</h3>

<p>
    <big>This section serves dual roles in both attracting basic scientists focused on the biological pathways that regulate the
        growth, development and differentiation of the gastrointestinal tract as well as clinicians interested in gastrointestinal
        diseases affecting the pediatric population. Here is more information about the GDCH section:</big>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <big>The section has interest in research focused on the regulation of the intestinal cell cycle in health and disease;
            pathways involved intestinal maintenance and repair; cell and animal models of intestinal stem cell biology.</big>
    </li>
    <li>
        <big>In recent years the GDCH section name was changed (from Growth, Development &amp; Aging) to its new name which more
            clearly focuses on child health. The section is considered the home for pediatrics in &nbsp;AGA.</big>
    </li>
    <li>
        <big>Although the section is among the smallest, attendance at GDCH sessions is consistently strong and it has strengthened
            our relationship with other sections by co-sponsoring symposia with cross descriptors of mutual interest.</big>
    </li>
</ul>
