<p>
    <big>The Pancreatic Disorders Section is dedicated to presenting the most up-to-date clinical and basic science information
        to as many &nbsp;dedicated members as possible. It provides an all-inclusive group of experts as speakers, who are
        whetted out by large number of stakeholders and peer reviewed on the best platform in the world.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>Members will be heard on this platform for their needs, views and aspirations.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>The section has made significant strides in the last two years by increasing the abstract submission by roughly30 percent
        and by increasing membership and international participation. This was done through a broad inclusion of numerous
        colleagues in a variety of roles, including serving as &nbsp;poster judges serving on poster rounds and as advisory
        councillors.</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>The section has continued to focus on translational sessions (highly popular clinical topics with cutting-edge basic
        science counterparts) to increase basic science membership and participation..</big>
</p>

<p>
    <big>The creation of NIH-focused themes and participation from NIH speakers will help lead to in more NIH funding for pancreatic
        diseases. The best clinical and basic science research and symposia should be in the AGA Pancreatic Disorders section.
        Additionally, the section should include the best junior and senior GI talent in the word.</big>
