<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The AGA Institute Quality Measures Committee will develop new and revise existing quality measures for gastroenterology and
    hepatology, with the goals of helping to define high-quality care and assuring the relevance and positive impact of AGA&#39;s
    measures. The quality measures committee will also support quality improvement initiatives among members and serve as
    an amplifying voice for members promoting high-value care. Finally, the committee will promote development of additional
    programs within the AGA Institute related to quality improvement.</p>

<h3>Committee Structure</h3>

<p>The committee will consist of 10 members (including a chair). The chairs of the AGA Institute Practice Management and Economics
    Committee and the AGA Institute Clinical Guidelines Committee (who shall not count against the maximum membership) shall
    be ex-officio members of the committee. A governing board member with knowledge about performance measurement (who shall
    not count against the maximum membership) shall serve as the governing board&rsquo;s liaison to the committee and shall
    attend all committee meetings; additional members of the governing board (who shall not count against the maximum membership)
    may be assigned as team members to the committee but are not intended to attend any committee meetings. A chair-elect
    (who shall not count against the maximum membership) shall be appointed one year before the end of the term of the chair.</p>

<p>Appointment terms of all committee members shall be for two years, with the opportunity to be renewed for an additional year
    based on attendance and performance. One-third of the maximum terms shall expire annually.</p>

<p>The committee chair is authorized to create small, temporary subgroups consisting of members and nonmembers of the committee
    to address specific issues within the committee&rsquo;s mission. Costs of all such subgroups must be included in the
    committee&rsquo;s approved budget.</p>
