    Mission</h3>

<p>To provide advice and guidance to the Governing Board on the financial and editorial strategies of existing and proposed
    publications (including both print and digital distribution), on the publications needed to fulfill the goals of the
    Strategic Plan, and on trends and developments in scientific publishing. The committee also provides general oversight
    of AGA publications, including development of relevant publication policies.</p>


<h3>Committee Functions</h3>

<p>In carrying out its duties, the committee will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Develop common strategic approaches to publishing to support the Strategic Plan and organizational priorities, including
        business plans.</li>
    <li>Identify and evaluate common challenges, opportunities and innovations in publishing and recommend approaches that are
        efficient, and editorially and fiscally sound.</li>
    <li>Foster synergy and collaboration among AGA&#39;s portfolio of print and digital publications, including news and social
        media, so as to avoid substantial overlap and to maximize their effectiveness.</li>
    <li>The medical-scientific content of AGA publications is the purview of their respective editors and is not subject to committee
        review or oversight unless specifically requested by the editors. Any nontrivial changes proposed by the editors
        involving publication design, format, content organization or procedures must be reviewd by the committee. If the
        committee believes that a proposed change may adversely affect the finances or reputation of the publication or the
        AGA, or may have adverse legal consequeneces, this opinion along with the committee&#39;s recommendation, shall be
        transmitted to the governing board for consideration.</li>
    <li>Review the financial performance of the publications relative to established budgets and financial parameters.</li>
    <li>Establish, and revise as necessary, policies on ethics, fees, advertising, press embargo and conflicts of interest.</li>
    <li>Establish RFPs for editors and appoint two members from the committee to sit on the editor selection committee in accordance
        with the established editor selection policy. (Note: these members must not have any conflicts of interest with the
        editor candidates or their proposed associated editors) and to review recommendations made by the selection committee.</li>
    <li>Review reports of the publication editorial boards to assure quality of publications, as measured by &mdash; but not
        limited to &mdash; impact factors for the journals, and timely and efficient review processes.</li>
</ul>
