<h2>Benefits of AGA Fellowship</h2>

<p>Earning AGAF is the hallmark of a committed association professional. It helps open doors, creates connections, and
    offers widespread value and recognition for certificants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an AGA Fellow, you will have the distinction of adding the designation &ldquo;AGAF&rdquo; in your professional
    activities. AGA will recognize your fellowship with a recognition pin and certificate upon acceptance. You can also
    use a&nbsp;press release&nbsp;template to inform the local media of your achievement and a badge&nbsp;to post on
    your website (both freely available, upon request). During Digestive Disease Week&reg;, you will be recognized with
    a ribbon denoting your fellowship status, and your name printed in the AGA Recognition and Research Awards booklet.
    Additionally, you will receive a digital ribbon within the AGA Community showcasing your AGA Fellowship status, and
    you will&nbsp;be listed as a fellow on the AGA website.</p>
