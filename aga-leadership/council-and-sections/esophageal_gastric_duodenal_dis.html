<h3>MISSION STATEMENT AND FOCI</h3>

<p>
    The EGD section continues to heavily contribute to the educational and research mission of the AGA Institute and remains
    a highly visible section at DDW&reg;.&nbsp; It is &nbsp;the second largest section in the AGA Council. The attendance
    at Digestive Disease Week&reg; (DDW) continues to be robust, with nearly all of the EGD section&rsquo;s clinical sessions
    exceeding expected capacity. The section is diverse in regards to representation of multiple upper GI diseases including
    esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.&nbsp; Advances continue to develop in the area of esophageal reflux and motility testing
    (e.g., high resolution manometry and mucosal impedance measurements), endoscopic reflux therapies as well as continued
    strong interest in both clinical and basic research in Eosinophilic esophagitis and Barrett&#39;s esophagus. Dominant
    areas of investigation in this section include esophageal physiologic testing, eosinophilic esophagitis, H. pylori infection
    and its chronic implications, GERD and extraesophageal GERD, Barrett&#39;s esophagus, esophageal and gastric dysmotility,
    and GI bleeding.

<p>
    Over the last few years, the EGD section intensified their efforts at reducing overlap by consolidating some of &nbsp;descriptors
    and proactively ensuring reduced programming redundancies.&nbsp; The section continues to work with other council sections
    in cross-sectional opportunities. Section leaders believe the EGD section will continue to play a pivotal role in providing
    excellence in research and education, and strive to meet these goals by thoughtful programming of clinical and research
    fora in line with the demand of section members.
