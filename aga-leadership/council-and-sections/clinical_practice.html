<h3>Mission Statement and FOCI</h3>

<p>
    The mission of the Clinical Practice section is to promote the optimum delivery of high quality, cost-effective gastrointestinal
        healthcare.&nbsp; Best practices will primarily be identified through cutting-edge research in areas such as epidemiology,
        population health screening, outcomes research, performance metrics, health economics, systematic reviews, practice
        management and medical education.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    As reimbursement for healthcare in the U.S. moves toward pay for performance, the Clinical Practice Section is particularly
        interested in research that develops and validates measures of quality in the management of gastrointestinal diseases.&nbsp;
        This will be achieved by studies that examine the implementation of quality assurance programs in clinical practice,
        or assess the impact of various policy alternatives including benefits and potential unintended consequences.
