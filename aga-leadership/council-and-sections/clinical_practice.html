<h3>Mission Statement and FOCI</h3>

<p>The mission of the AGA Institute Council Clinical Practice Section is to promote the optimum delivery of high quality, cost-effective
    gastrointestinal health care. Best practices will primarily be identified through cutting-edge research in areas such
    as epidemiology, population health screening, outcomes research, performance metrics, health economics, systematic reviews,
    practice management and medical education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As reimbursement for health care in the U.S. moves toward pay for performance, the clinical practice section is particularly
    interested in research that develops and validates measures of quality in the management of gastrointestinal diseases.&nbsp;This
    will be achieved by studies that examine the implementation of quality assurance programs in clinical practice, or assess
    the impact of various policy alternatives including benefits and potential unintended consequences.</p>

    <li>Health care delivery and policy (practice, reimbursement, access to care, policy).</li>
    <li>Epidemiology.</li>
    <li>Systematic reviews and meta-analysis.</li>
