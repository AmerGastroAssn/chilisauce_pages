        Dr. Sandler received his undergraduate degree,<em> summa cum laude</em>, from Union College in Schenectady, NY.
        He received his medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, and his masters of public
        health from University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill. Dr. Sandler has committed his entire professional
        career to UNC, serving in growing capacities since he first joined the department of medicine as a GI fellow in
        1978. He now serves as the Nina C. and John T. Sessions distinguished professor of medicine.</p>

    <p>Dr. Sandler can be credited with giving the field of digestive disease epidemiology and outcomes an early boost.
        He has maintained an extraordinarily productive career over the past 30 years that has focused on research
        investigating the etiology and prevention of colon cancer; training and mentoring a generation of GI
        epidemiologists and academic gastroenterologists; directing the UNC&rsquo;s multidisciplinary NIDDK-funded
        Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease; developing a national clinical trials data management resource;
        and leading an outstanding division of gastroenterology and hepatology.</p>

    <p>Dr. Sandler has worked selflessly for AGA in many capacities. In May 2015, he was appointed to the AGA Governing
        Board as AGA Research Foundation chair-elect, and now serves as chair. This will be Dr. Sandler&rsquo;s third
        term on the board; notably he served as president of AGA from 2008 to 2009. Before his most recent appointment
        to the governing board, Dr. Sandler served as chair of the AGA Publications Committee, and has previously served
        on the Nominating Committee (twice &mdash; once as chair), Audit Committee, Executive Committee, Outcomes
        Research Award Review Panel, Futures Committee, Research Policy Committee, Burden of Disease Task Force, Public
        Policy Committee and GI Oncology Task Force. Dr. Sandler has also served as an associate editor of <em>Gastroenterology</em>.
