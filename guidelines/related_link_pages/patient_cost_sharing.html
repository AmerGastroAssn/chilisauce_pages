<h3>AGA Urges Correction of Medicare Beneficiary Cost Sharing for Screening Colonoscopy</h3>

<p>Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act marked a major victory in the fight against cancer. The law
    waives the coinsurance and deductible for many cancer screening tests,<sup>1</sup> including colonoscopy,
    sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), which screen for colorectal cancer. However, due to the unique
    nature of colonoscopy, many patients wind up paying out of pocket. AGA urges Congress to correct this &ldquo;cost
    sharing&rdquo; problem.</p>

<h3>The Colonoscopy Loophole</h3>

<p>Colonoscopy is a unique screening test because gastroenterologists are able to remove precancerous polyps and small
    cancers during the screening procedure. Under Medicare coding rules, removal of any polyp reclassifies the screening
    as a therapeutic procedure for which patients must pay coinsurance.This means a patient can go to the
    gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy assuming it&rsquo;s free, only to receive a bill for the coinsurance after the
    doctor finds and removes a suspicious polyp.</p>

<p>The Obama administration issued a set of FAQs on the implementation of preventive benefits to the ACA that clarified
    that private insurers cannot impose cost sharing for a screening colonoscopy that turns therapeutic since polyp
    removal is &ldquo;an integral part of a colonoscopy.&rdquo; AGA strongly supported this guidance and continues to
    advocate for this policy change in Medicare.</p>

<p>However, AGA urges Congress to correct this &ldquo;cost sharing&rdquo; problem for Medicare patients. The Removing
    Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act, legislation introduced by Rep. Charlie Dent, R-PA, Rep. Donald Payne,
    Jr., D-NJ, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-OH, Sen. Susan Collins, R-ME, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-MD, and Sen. Roger Wicker,
    R-MS, would correct this cost sharing problem for Medicare patients by waiving the coinsurance for a screening
    colonoscopy regardless of the outcome.</p>

<p>We are also concerned that asymptomatic patients who have a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal
    immunochemical test (FIT), and thus require a screening colonoscopy, would be subject to cost-sharing for the
    colonoscopy. These screening tests are integral to increasing overall colorectal cancer screening rates. After a
    positive FOBT or FIT, the subsequent colonoscopy examination is necessary to properly examine the entire colon and
    remove tissue/polyp(s) found during the procedure. This process is still part of the &ldquo;screening&rdquo; and
    completes the continuum of care in colorectal cancer screening. Thus, Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing should be
    waived for the subsequent colonoscopy. AGA continues to work with CMS to urge them to define &ldquo;colorectal
    cancer screening&rdquo; to address the continuum of care for screening colonoscopy and include those scenarios in
    which patients who have a positive FOBT/FIT require a subsequent colonoscopy.</p>

<h3>Patient Impact</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;">Cost sharing creates financial barriers, which discourage the use of recommended preventive services. This could have a major impact on colorectal cancer screening since more than one third of U.S. adults age 50 and older have never been screened.</span>
</p>

<h3>2011 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule</h3>

<p>CMS stated in the 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule that legislative action is necessary to waive the
    beneficiary coinsurance for colorectal cancer screenings that become therapeutic during the same clinical
    encounter.</p>

<b>Bottom line: Screening colonoscopy is the most cost effective test for prevention of colorectal cancer. Patients
    should be incentivized, through the elimination of cost sharing, to use colonoscopy as a colorectal cancer screening
    mechanism. Additionally, the preventive screening benefit has contributed to the decline in colorectal cancer rates
    in our country and this benefit should be preserved in any health-care reform legislation.</b>

<p>Reference<br/>
    <small>(1) Sec. 4104 of the &ldquo;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&rdquo; (ACA) waives the beneficiary
        coinsurance and deductible for covered preventive services that have a grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;B&rdquo;
        from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing
        (FOBT) have all been assigned an &ldquo;A&rdquo; rating from the USPSTF for adults beginning at age 50 and
        continuing until age 75.<br/>
        Sec. 4104 also requires, effective Jan. 1, 2011, the deductible for colorectal cancer screenings be waived for
        Medicare beneficiaries regardless of the code that is billed for the establishment of a diagnosis as a result of
        the test, or for the removal of tissue or other matter or other procedure that is furnished in connection with,
        as a result of, and in the same clinical encounter as a screening test.
