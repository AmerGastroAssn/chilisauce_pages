    <strong>Session Time:</strong> 10–11:30 a.m.<br>
    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> The recent and unfortunate occurrences of transmission of infection in
    gastrointestinal
    endoscopy, especially ERCP, have led to widespread public awareness, litigation and a re-examination of our
    reprocessing practices and guidelines. This session seeks to address the basis of bacterial transmission; quality
    assurance efforts and monitoring for occult transmission; physician liability and risk management; and society’s
    response to standards of reprocessing.</p>

    <strong>Session Date:</strong> Sunday, June 3<br>
    <strong>Session Time:</strong> 4–5:30 p.m.<br>
    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> Clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease don’t always follow
    endoscopic or
    histological degree of inflammation. In fact, they almost never do. In the modern era, direct visual inspection by
    endoscopy, with or without tissue acquisition for pathological evaluation, may no longer be the best method for
    diagnosing and staging IBD. This session will review a variety of technological advances that when applied to
    inflammatory bowel disease have the potential to change our practice.</p>

<p><strong>Session Title:</strong> Advanced Endoscopy of the Biliary Tract<br>

    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> Over the past few years, interventional endoscopists have been inundated
    with an array of
    tools and methods to improve the diagnosis of biliary disease. This session seeks to compare and contrast some of
    the commonly used endoscopic techniques for tissue sampling as well as examine how newer imaging technologies such
    as cholangioscopy, confocal endoscopy and optical coherence tomography may be applied to biliary disease.</p>


<p><strong>Session Title:</strong> Advances in Imaging of Pancreatic Disease<br>
    <strong>Session Date:</strong> Saturday, June 2<br>
    <strong>Session Time:</strong> 8–9:30 a.m.<br>
    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> Technological achievements have always preceded advances in clinical
    outcomes. In many ways,
    technological improvements in medical imaging are among the most relevant to our specialty. This session will
    highlight not only the most important imaging advances of 2017-2018, but it will also provide a glimpse into the
    future of pancreatic imaging.</p>

<p>Research Mentor Award<br>
    The award will be presented to Michael B. Wallace, MD, MPH, AGAF, during the session, Advances in Imaging and
    Therapy of the Pancreas and Biliary System on Saturday, June 2, 4-5:30 p.m., 4:28-4:34 p.m. in Room144.</p>

    <strong>Session Time:</strong> 10-11:30 a.m.<br>
    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> Autoimmune liver disease remains an enigma. Diagnosis is by exclusion for
    classic autoimmune
    hepatitis and overlap syndromes complicate both diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. In this session, John
    Vierling, MD, FACP, FAASLD will elucidate the features of autoimmune-mediated liver processes, providing tips and
    guidance for clinicians.</p>

<p><strong>Session Title:</strong> AGA Emmet B. Keeffe Symposium—Hepatitis D: Forgotten but Not Lost<br>

    <strong>Session Time:</strong> 10-11:30 a.m.<br>
    <strong>Why you Should Attend:</strong> The diagnosis of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection remains elusive. Patients
    with chronic
    hepatitis B can have co-infection with HDV for years. Without specific testing, the patient and their physicians
    would be unaware. In this special session in honor of Emmett Keeffe, the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of
    HDV will be explored.</p>

<p>Research Mentor Award<br>
    The award will be presented to Scott L. Friedman during the AGA Emmet B. Keeffe Symposium— Hepatitis D: Forgotten
